ðŸš€ **Let's shake things up in KVM technology together!**

We're hard at work developing [the host applications](https://openterface.com/quick-start/#install-host-application) for this handy gadget. Our team is coding away and tweaking these tools to boost their performance and functionality. Weâ€™re all about open hardware and open-source software, and we'll keep sharing updates throughout our campaign.

Check out some early demos demonstrating the basic operation of our host application [here](https://openterface.com/basic-testing/).

**Openterface Mini-KVM** allows you to control a headless target device, such as a mini PC, kiosk, or server, directly from your laptop or desktop without the need for an extra keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

It's a plug-and-play tool that connects via HDMI for display and USB for emulated keyboard/mouse (HID) signals. It requires minimal setup: install our host application on your host computer, and you're ready to have on-the-go headless control.

## Control Your Devices Whenever and Wherever
